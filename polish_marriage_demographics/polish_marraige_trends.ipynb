    "# Analysis\n",
    "## Women\n",
    "For age groups 30-34 and 35-39, there has been relatively minor change in the number of marriages  compared to the changes in  20-24 and 25-29 age brackets. For women aged group 20-24 the number of marriages has dropped by 66% and has fallen by 60% for a those aged 25-29 (while still remaining the most popular age group for marriage). The sharp decline in marriages for women aged 20-29 aligns with the overall decreasing crude marriage rate for Poland. This indicates that the decline in marriages has been driven by younger women.\n",
    "\n",
    "What stands out is that there is no significant increase in marriages for women aged 30-39. We can infer that there is likely a sociological factor at play. As seen elsewhere, there could be a cultural shift away from marriage in general, where the importance of marriage has decreased or are forgoing marriage altogether.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Men\n",
    "The trends for men closely mirror that of women. Marriages by men of ages 20-24 has fallen by 75% and has fallen by 50% for men aged 25-29. And as in the case with women, marriages in the early and late thirties has remained relatively constant.\n",

    "# Findings\n",
    "For our client, we provided the insight:\n",
    "* The overall rate of marriage in Poland has been decreasing since 2008, and has begun to closely mirror the trends of Europe\n",
    "* The decline in marriages is heavily influenced by a decline in the number of young men and women between ages 20-29 getting married\n",
    "* The number of marriages by those in their 30's remained relatively stable\n"
